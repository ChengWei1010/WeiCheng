				<h5>Process</h5>
				<p>
					We applied the design thinking methodology as our process, but we changed a bit on the discover phase into <b>observe</b> and <b>research</b> because this project is based on the goal to create an educational technology for children and we want to open for other opportunities based on observing children in the real world.

				<h5>Observation</h5>
				<p>
					We went to Austin Central Public Library to observe what kind of technology or game do most children like to play on the computers. It turned out that preschool children (3-5) likes to interact with the art related, language-free games. The child I observed was a 4-years old girl, the game she was playing is called PAINT.Through the observation, we have these takeaways:

					<div class="col-three"><img src="artism/observe-2.svg" alt="" class="img-col-three"></div>
					<div class="col-three"><img src="artism/observe-3.svg" alt="" class="img-col-three"></div>
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Drawing can be a communication way. </b>English is not the first language of the little girl we observed, but we could still feel and know what her current emotions through her painting activity.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Interacting with touchscreen.</b> Even though there are keyboards and mouse that specially designed for them, they still use fingers.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Need feedbacks and instructions when interacting with technology.</b>The girl couldn’t know some of the meaning of the tools. It’s better to implement appropriate instructions in technologies.
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h5>Interview</h5>
				<p>
					The goal of this interview phase is to found out their child’s use of technology and their beliefs about how technology influences children. We interviewed the little girl’s mother for 20 minutes with 5 questions and open for her own sharing. The mother told us that technology is a tool that can help kids learning in this new generation, just like books and toys.
					Some insights from the interview are:
					<ol>
						<li>
							<b>Parents prefer technology has educational meaning to preschool children.</b><br>Technologies provide kids new approaches to complete task. Kids could pre-prepare for school work with skills learning from touchscreen.
						</li>
						<li>
							<b>Painting apps help kids to learn different hand movements and hand-eye coordination.</b><br>The physical drawing includes more senses, such as the smell of the crayon, the feel of paper, or the sounds of scratching on paper. As for painting on the computer, it included other cognitive understanding like knowing the difference between each function, and the meaning of symbols.
						</li>
					</ol>

				<h6>1.The Prevalence of Autism</h6>
				<img src="artism/research-1.jpg" alt="research-1" class="img-col-one">				
				<p>We conducted literature review to find out potential related topics that we can do. According to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), based on an analysis of 2014-2018 medical and educational records of 8-11 year-old autism’s estimated prevalence among children in US is 1 in 49 kids. Thus, we decide to set our target need group as the preschool kids (3-5 years old) with autism spectrum disorder.</p>

				<h6>2.Using Social Stories to teach communication</h6>
				<img src="artism/research-2.jpg" alt="research-2" class="img-col-one">				
				<p>Social stories are short stories that describe social situations in terms of relevant social cues and often define appropriate responses (Gray & Garand, 1993). Studies shows that for some children with ASD, social stories have been successful in improving their responses to social situations within a short period of time.</p>

				<h6>3.The use of Art Thearpy</h6>
				<img src="artism/research-3.jpg" alt="research-3" class="img-col-one">				
				<p>Individuals with autism often experience anxiety, stress, depression, and frustration as a result of their symptoms and the social impact of their symptoms (Martin, 2009). Round, Baker & Rayner (2017) found that the art making process was associated with improved speech, communication, and social interaction. Therefore, due to the benefits of art therapy about emotional and behavioral development, and the goal of our technology to enhance the emotion expression, we decide to apply this method in our design.
